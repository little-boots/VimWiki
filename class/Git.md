#Git

##Commits
Think "checkpoints"
Shoot for making a commit once you've added some new functionality.

###Branching
All commits live on branches.  Master branch is the initial commit.
You can create new branches to work on new features
Once you finish your work, merge it back to the master.

##Remote Repositories
Sync with `git pull`
